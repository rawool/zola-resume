        </div>
        <p class="text-sm text-[var(--primary)] mb-2">Shine</p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-2">I arrived at the creation of the infrastructure team, when the company realized that it needed to have a dedicated team to manage the infrastructure. We are now a team of 3 people, and we are responsible for the entire infrastructure of Shine. My missions can be slight changes (like adding a optional feature to an existing resource), big projects (like implementing a complete hosting solution on top of GCP with Terraform), or to prepare the future by creating tailored Terraform modules for the developers. We rely heavily on tools like Terraform, GCP, ElasticSeach, Grafana.</p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-2">My key responsibilities include managing Shine's entire infrastructure in GCP, covering containers (serverless), instances (MIG), queues, databases, and load-balancers. I spearheaded the transition from manual infrastructure management to Terraform, providing several repositories in self-service mode with helpful and tailored modules. Additionally, I automated processes via GitHub Actions and set up comprehensive monitoring with Grafana (in Terraform), managing logs, metrics, and dashboards.</p>

        <p class="text-sm text-[var(--primary)] mb-2">Alma</p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-2">I was the first Site Reliability Engineer when we started the Platform team. At that time, our team grew to 12 members, and we handled infrastructure (mostly cloud-based), security, data, and enhancing the developer experience.</p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-2">We relied on Terraform, GCP, CloudFlare, Datadog, and Python for our work.</p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-2">I managed Alma's entire infrastructure on GCP, including containers (K8S and serverless), queues, databases, load-balancers, and more. A major achievement was transitioning infrastructure management from Python scripts to Terraform. I ensured security and compliance through hardening, isolation, various mTLS setups with internal CAs, and utilizing CloudFlare (tunnels, rules, workers, access, LB). My work involved writing Python scripts, automating processes via GitHub Actions, and setting up comprehensive monitoring with Datadog (in Terraform) for logs, metrics, and dashboards. I also served on-call for Level 2 support.</p>
